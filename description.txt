The AotC Rework is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I prefer the look of the old one WAY more. Combine that with a few other things i'd change/add, I decided to make this mod.
Currently has the base swing cycle and ablities added. If you have Calamity installed, it's craftable with shadowspec bars.
Things I will hopefully add:
New Abilities
New AotC version built in to the main weapon
Fully restore the old version
I might also add more weapons if i feel like it once I'm done with the main one

If people are actually reading this and you find any issues or questions or whatever, ArkoftheCosmos#6107 on discord, my DM's are open (at least i think they are)



I really hope this isnt copyright infringment or something like that.
